                <h1>WHAT IS BURNOUT?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you’re feeling stressed out at work, you’re not alone. 83% of US workers are suffering from 
                    some kind of work-related stress, which causes one million people to miss work every day.
                    <br><br>
                    As more and more people work from home during the coronavirus pandemic, work-related stress may 
                    increase as the boundaries between work and home life become blurred. If this stress becomes 
                    overwhelming, it can cause burnout.
                    <br><br>
                    Burnout is a type of work-related stress. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists burnout as 
                    an ‘occupational phenomenon‘ in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Though it 
                    is not considered a medical condition, WHO notes that it can influence your health, and cause 
                    you to reach out to health services.
                    <br><br>
                    “Burnout describes the thoughts and feelings associated with feeling overwhelmed and fatigued 
                    by life circumstances,” says Rachel O’Neill, Ph.D., a practicing therapist and Director of 
                    Clinical Effectiveness for Talkspace.
                    <br><br>
                    The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is a survey designed by Christina Maslach, a psychology 
                    professor from the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1980s. The MBI is still used 
                    today by health professionals as the main way to assess burnout, and it is the basis for 
                    WHO's definition of the condition.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>Burnout Symptoms</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While burnout includes many of the same symptoms as stress, there are three specific feelings 
                    that differentiate burnout:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Feeling tired or exhausted
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lack of enthusiasm and increased negativity towards your job
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decreased ability to perform your job
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Often, burnout results in depressive symptoms, such as sadness or a lack of hope, O’Neill says. 
                    But it can also contribute to a wide range of negative emotions and even physical symptoms, such as:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Frustration or anger
                </p>
                <p>
                    Irritability or annoyance
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anxiety, agitation, or restlessness
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physical feelings of stress, such as headaches, stomach issues, body pains, or fatigue
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>Causes of Work Burnout</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A 2018 study of 7,500 workers in the USA showed that employees suffering from burnout 
                    are 63% more likely to take sick days, show less confidence in their work performance, 
                    and are more than twice as likely to leave their job.
                    <br>
                    The study found the top reasons for burnout included: 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Unfair treatment at work
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unmanageable workload
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lack of clarity in role
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not enough communication or support from manager
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unrealistic time pressure
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Moreover, a selection of studies from the American Institute of Stress found that the 
                    biggest sources of stress at work were: ineffective communication (80%); too much workload 
                    (39%); demands from their manager or supervisor (35%); and unclear expectations (31%).
                    <br><br>
                    As more people work from home during the coronavirus pandemic, O’Neill says many of these 
                    problems — poor communication, isolation and lack of support, difficulty meeting 
                    deadlines, and environmental distractions — could all worsen feelings of burnout and be 
                    difficult on your mental health.

                <h1>WHAT IS COMPASSION FATIGUE?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Compassion fatigue is a broadly defined concept that can include emotional, physical, and 
                    spiritual distress in those providing care to another. It is associated with caregiving 
                    where people or animals are experiencing significant emotional or physical pain and suffering.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Causes of Compassion Fatigue</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Feeling empathy for those you care for may seem like a given, it may even be the reason you're 
                    doing what you do, but this empathy can often go too far, leading you to feel the symptoms of 
                    compassion fatigue as you suffer from another person’s trauma. 
                    <br><br>
                    Compassion fatigue, or vicarious/secondary trauma, is much more serious than general burnout: 
                    it’s a caregiver experiencing trauma after witnessing another’s physical, emotional, or 
                    spiritual pain. Concept pioneers McCann and Pearlman define it as “a process through which the 
                    caregiving individual’s own internal experience becomes transformed through engagement with 
                    the client’s trauma” (1990). 
                    <br><br>
                    According to the Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project, anywhere from 25–50% of healthcare 
                    workers experience symptoms of compassion fatigue. Everyone from long-term care workers to 
                    family caregivers to emergency room nurses to police officers may find themselves taking 
                    on others’ trauma.
